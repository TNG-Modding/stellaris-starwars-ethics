 psionics:0 "Force Studies"
 psionics_desc:0 "Mind over matter."

 tech_psionic_shield:0 "Force Shields"
 tech_psionic_shield_desc:0 "These extremely powerful shields are generated by a cadre of Force sensitives. Their powers are further augmented by large arrays of Force energy conductors."
 
 tech_psionic_barrier:0 "Force Barrier"
 tech_psionic_barrier_desc:0 "These barriers are generated by a cadre of Force sensitives. They will be able to stop some incoming fire, like our Energy deflector systems, but without the prohibitive power consumption."

 tech_psi_jump_drive_1:0 "Force Jump Drive"
 tech_psi_jump_drive_1_desc:1 "The Force Jump Drive harnesses the force energies of the crew to force the vessel through the very fabric of reality, instantly "jumping" vast distances."
 
 tech_mine_zro:0 "Zro Distillation"
 tech_mine_zro_desc:3 "An extremely rare aerosol of exotic particles. It has been deposited on a number of worlds through meteor impacts, but its true origin is a mystery. If ingested by Force sensitive individuals, Zro acts as a very potent (and addictive) drug that enhances Force abilities."
 
 tech_psionic_theory:0 "Force Theory"
 tech_psionic_theory_desc:1 "The mind is in many ways a reflection of the Force itself, a microcosmos. All species may not reach this insight, but their minds are tools greater than any other."
 
 tech_telepathy:0 "Telepathy"
 tech_telepathy_desc:1 "Once fully adapted to the Force, the mind is capable of connecting to other individuals, becoming something greater."
 tech_transcendent_thought:0 "Transcendent Thought"

 tech_precognition_interface:0 "Precognition Interface"
 tech_precognition_interface_desc:1 "Advances in Force studies suggest the possibility of creating combat computers capable of reading and analysing the impulses of Force sensitives before they are cognitively processed."
 
 tech_psi_jump_drives:0 "Force Jump Drives"
 tech_psi_jump_drives_desc:1 "The Force Jump Drive harnesses the Force energies of the crew to force the vessel through the very fabric of reality, instantly "jumping" vast distances."
