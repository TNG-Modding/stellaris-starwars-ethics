 crisis.1250.name:0 "The Warlock"
 crisis.1250.desc:0 "When the swirling energies left behind after the destruction of the last dimensional portal finally dissipated, our forces found a weakened extradimensional drifting nearby. The creature was captured and interrogated.\n\nIt is apparently one of their "§HWarlocks§!" - a powerful extradimensional even by their standards, responsible for maintaining the portal's link between our reality and theirs. If we can study or even channel its Force energies, we should be able to greatly improve our sublight speeds and jump drive range."

 ancrel.1.name:0 "Mysterious ruins"
 ancrel.1.desc:0 "[From.Planet.GetName] contains the remains of an ancient, abandoned colony. From orbit there are no obvious signs of disaster which would have killed the inhabitants or compelled them to flee. If we want answers, an expedition to the surface will be required."
 ancrel.2.desc:0 "The strange ruins show no sign of damage beyond neglect. Homes, factories, buildings of unknown use, they all stand empty and abandoned. Where did everyone go? For unknown reasons it seems like a large building in the center of the colony may hold the answers."
 ancrel.3.name:0 "Strange Crystal"
 ancrel.3.desc:0 "A large crystal has been found inside what we now know to have been the colony's central administrative center. In some way, the Holicron wanted to be found and seems to be trying to communicate with us. Perhaps with further study communication will be possible?"
 ancrel.3.a:0 "Probe the Crystal"
 ancrel.4.desc:0 "After a great deal of trial and error, a breakthrough has been made. The crystal is some kind of Holicron, but its records are fragmented. What we know is that this was a colony of The Zroni, a Force sensitive race who discovered a dimension which came to be known as "The shroud". Once the Zroni population reached a certain critical mass it seems that their collective unconscious minds began to make contact with the proto-shroud in dreams, leading to mass lucid dreaming. Soon the phenomenon was studied and the Zroni discovered how tos project themselves into the Shroud, where they found that they could manipulate the very fabric of reality with their Force energies. It wasn't long before the Zroni discovered they could physically enter the Shroud and live like Gods, transforming the dimension to suit their whims...\n\nThe Archive's records end there, with no information on what happened to the inhabitants of [From.Planet.GetName]. But while there are no answers here, we have learned of another Zroni colony which may contain a more complete Archive."
 ancrel.5.desc:0 "[From.Planet.GetName] contains the ruins of another abandoned Zroni colony. The first step to solving this mystery is to find and make contact with this world's Holicron."
 ancrel.6.desc:0 "Using protocols established with the previous Holicron it was much easier to establish contact with this one. Again it's records are fragmented, but we have learned that another advantage of being able to enter the Shroud was that the Shroud touches all parts of the physical galaxy (perhaps all parts of the universe) simultaneously. If one can enter the Shroud, it is possible to exit it at any known location. This ability to jump between physical locations using the Force allowed the Zroni to spread to all corners of the galaxy, although because they spent most of their time within the Shroud they made few permanent colonies which were mostly located near to their homeworld.\n\n The Holicron also gave us the location of another colony."
 ancrel.7.desc:0 "Finding and communicating with the Holicron archives has become much easier now. Contact can be made as soon as our expedition lands, and more detailed records and concepts can be accessed. From what we have learned here, some things are too good to be true, and so it was with the Shroud-granted Godhood of the Zroni. The energy needed to power the vast changes in the Shroud's composition had to come from somewhere, and it was finally found to originate from the massive black hole at the center of the galaxy. As the Zroni made their changes within the Shroud, so the singularity expanded, consuming the mass of the galactic center and converting it into energy which was siphoned into the Shroud. This discovery shook the Zroni, debate turn to argument, turned to division, turned to civil war between two main factions."
 ancrel.8.desc:0 "Further details of the Zroni civil war factions have been extracted from the Holicron: One faction, which came to be known as "The Divine", felt that the fate of the physical galaxy was of no concern to the Zroni, who could continue their omnipotent existence in the Shroud until the entire galaxy was consumed in some unimaginably far off future- and even then, there are other galaxies, perhaps even other universes which could possibly be consumed. The other faction, "The Saviors", were aghast at this- the Zroni could not destroy the galaxy to live as parasitic gods! Even outside of the Shroud, their Force abilities guaranteed them a utopian existence.\n\n The location of another Zroni colony was also discovered."
 ancrel.9.desc:0 "It was strangely difficult to locate the Archive on [From.Planet.GetName], but once found it was easy to see why: It has been shattered and contains no records that we can access. However, a faint signal suggests that there may be something else to find here."
 ancrel.9.a:0 "Continue searching"
 ancrel.10.desc:0 "A much smaller Holicron has been located in some kind of laboratory. The Zroni who recorded their findings within were extremely frustrated that their research was ridiculed by their peers and largely discredited. They believed that the Zroni were no longer the only entities in the Shroud, and that the collective fears and desires of their entire race were coalescing into distinct, sapient entities. Desiring to grow stronger, these entities had began to subtly influence the emotions and thoughts of suitable Zroni, slowly causing their behaviors to become more extreme which may have caused the Zroni civil war.\n\nWe also discovered a reference to the location of one of the Zroni's major colonies."
 ancrel.11.desc:0 "Unlike the previous Zroni worlds, [From.Planet.GetName] was clearly a major colony with several huge cities and numerous smaller ones covering the surface. But like the others it is empty and shows no signs of disaster or death, leaving the fate of the population unknown. Several Holicrons have been detected and will need to be investigated."
 ancrel.12.desc:0 "Most of the accessible records focus on the course of the war. Our working theory is that the thoughts of the population influences the "strength" of the record about a subject, causing the most thought about issues to be the most strongly recorded. Unsurprisingly, the course of the war was on everyone's mind: The majority of the Zroni sided with the Saviors, but while the Saviors had the numbers they were at a major disadvantage. Careless of the effects on the galaxy, the Divine were free to use their full might while the Saviors were limited by what power could be drawn from their own bodies. At first the war seemed hopeless, but eventually a hero among the Saviors made a terrible yet vital discovery."
 ancrel.12.a:0 "Investigate the discovery"
 ancrel.13.desc:0 "The Holicron tells us how a rogue Zroni Force wielder, working on a theory which his peers refused to believe, turned his power inwards, consuming his own body in a contained chain-reaction. Following his last instructions, the dusty residue of his supreme sacrifice was tested and confirmed to be an incredibly potent source of Force energies. It was essentially the total Force essence of his life, but able to be used instantly by another Force wielder.\n\nThe Holicron also contains the location of the Zroni homeworld."
 ancrel.13.a:0 "The dust...is the Zroni!"
 ancrel.15.desc:0 "Zron is wracked by storms of Force energy, and appears to only be partially in phase with the rest of the universe at times. Whatever calamity befell the Zroni seems to have originated here.\n\nLike all the previous colonies, it is devoid of any Zroni, but it is teeming with Holicron signals. With so many of them and the strange conditions, it may take some time for us to locate any useful information."
 ancrel.16.desc:0 "We have found and communicated with several Holicrons, including one from the outcast Shroud-entity researchers, to learn more about the Zroni's war: Using the Zro dust required great sacrifice from the Saviors but with it they were able to turn the tide against the Divine. However, as defeat loomed the ever-increasing rage and fear of the Divine spawned new and terrible entities within the Shroud. The feedback loop grew, pushing the Divine into the depths of madness and produced ever-worsening atrocities while the Saviors became more and more driven to end the war at any cost."
 ancrel.16.a:0 "Continue"
 ancrel.17.desc:0 "As we communicate with more Holicrons, more details emerge: The Divine, on the brink of defeat, decided upon their ultimate plan: The end of the cycle. The core black hole's growth would be accelerated to consume the galaxy as soon as possible. At worst, the Saviors (and every other species) would be destroyed, leaving the Divine to rule the shroud for a vast but finite time, but it was possible that the expansion would become self-sustaining, consuming not just the galaxy but the universe itself, providing if not infinite energy then a close enough amount to make no practical difference."
 ancrel.18.desc:0 "We have learned the fate of the Zroni: When the Saviors learned of the Divine's plan, they knew there was only one possible counter as the Divine's defenses in the Shroud were almost impenetrable. Faced with annihilation, they choose to sacrifice their entire population, besides one Zroni. This last remaining Savior used the Force residue of an entire species to destroy every Zroni, and thus every Divine, in existence, ending the threat for all time. Beyond a small amount of unconsumed dust, the Zroni were wiped out almost without a trace."
 ancrel.18.a:0 "Inconceivable"
 ancrel.19.desc:0 "As our expedition made ready to leave, one of the Holicrons suddenly made contact again and indicated it could prove useful and should be taken with us. Even if it's claim isn't true, none of the other Holicrons seemed sapient, so this warrants further investigation."
 ancrel.19.a:0 "Take the Holicron"
 ancrel.21.name:0 "Ruined world"
 ancrel.21.desc:0 "Massive, dilapidated structures cover the entire surface of this world. At one time, this city-planet must have been home to billions but now it is empty. Whoever once lived here must have left clues about what happened to them, but finding them will take a detailed examination of the surface."
 ancrel.22.desc:0 "After much fruitless sifting through the ruins, a number of clues pointed our search in the right direction: The remains of some kind of planetary dataprocessing and storage center. If we can find a way to gain access to whatever records remain they will be the key to unraveling this planet's mysterious past."
 ancrel.23.desc:0 "Once an entrance to the data center had been found and passage forced through the wreckage it was surprisingly easy to reactivate and interface with the computer systems. Self-repairing circuits and learning algorithms quickly came online to restore limited functionality and communicate with our own computers. The reason for this quickly became clear, [From.Planet.GetName] was once the capital of a Machine Empire known as "The Omnicodex". Named after their driving purpose, the Omni were a hybrid of robots and cyborgs, who had attempted to assimilate a sample of all biological life in the galaxy in order to prevent their extinction in an unknown galactic calamity. From the surviving records, we gather that this was not popular with the other galactic powers of their era, and they were eventually defeated and destroyed by a combined attack by several of them. However, before their downfall the Omni sampled many races and much work was put into devolving a device which could re-create them if the need ever arose. This device, The Omnicodex itself, is stored somewhere nearby."
 ancrel.24.desc:0 "The Omnicodex has been unearthed. This unique device contains the genetic sequence of every race that the Omni were able to sample, and is able to re-create them using only basic elements as raw materials. Unfortunately, it seems the Omni did not have time to perfect it before being annihilated so there is no way to select which of the many sampled races are created in any given activation of the device."
