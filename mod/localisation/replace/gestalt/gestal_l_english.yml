 ancrel.9240.desc:0 "Our surface expedition has reported back some astounding findings. The planet has multiple major cities, all abandoned but in quite good shape considering their age. The infrastructure and urban planning of each city is remarkably structured and harmonious, indicating a highly cohesive civilization driven by centralized, collective ideals - perhaps even a Force consciousness of some kind.\n\nBased on the architecture and interior fixtures, the species that built all this seems to have been small fungoids, with a fairly low state of technical advancement. Where exactly they all went remains unknown."

They have formed their own, hidden communities, and now spend their time pilfering resources from the rest of the hive.\n\nTo prevent this, a temporary solution could be to engage the drones in some sort of activity program that keeps them too busy to stray from the will of the Force Consciousness. It will not be cheap, but this would give us additional time to create more jobs.\n\nWe could also do nothing, but this would likely result in the formation of significant deviant drone communities on [Root.GetName]."
