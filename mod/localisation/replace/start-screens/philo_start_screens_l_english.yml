 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_THEOCRATIC_MONARCHY:0 "Many false prophets took it upon themselves to offer spiritual guidance to our people as we advanced through the ages, but the true faith prevailed. The last heathen strongholds were vanquished after several bloody crusades, uniting us under the holy will of a single divine leader."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_THEOCRATIC_OLIGARCHY:0 "As we progressed through the technological ages, there were many religions among our people that contended with each other for followers. Gradually, sometimes peacefully and sometimes less so, the true faith found its way to all corners of our world and the faithful were united under a single universal church."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_THEOCRATIC_REPUBLIC:0 "Great achievements were made, both in the advancement of science and on the spiritual plane as we sought to expand our understanding of the universe and the role we play in it. A council of our most learned priests was convened to advise our elected leaders, a tradition that continues to this day."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MILITARY_REPUBLIC:0 "As we advanced through the ages, many of our earliest nation states suffered greatly from the constant power struggles between the military and civilian institutions that governed society. A compromise was reached in a new form of government, where one could not exist without the other."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MARTIAL_EMPIRE:0 "Countless nation states formed as we advanced through the technological ages, warring against each other until only one remained. Although the fighting was often brutal, those who survived nurtured a martial tradition that has prevailed to this day."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_ASSEMBLY_OF_CLANS:0 "As we advanced through the ages, many of our earliest nation states suffered greatly from the constant power struggles between the military and civilian institutions that governed society. A compromise was reached in a new form of government, where one could not exist without the other."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_CITIZEN_STRATOCRACY:0 "Many wars were fought between our early nation states, and those who could not defend themselves disappeared or were absorbed by stronger neighbors. These endless wars fostered a strong martial tradition, and to this day full citizenship is reserved for those who have proved willing to sacrifice themselves in defense of the state."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_IRENIC_MONARCHY:0 "The violent periods of our history reached a peaceful conclusion when we were united under a single monarch for the first time. An unbroken era of peace and prosperity followed, which has lasted to this day."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_IRENIC_BUREAUCRACY:0 "Unfortunately, our undisciplined minds were still prone to emotional outbursts that could sometimes lead to violence. As weapons became more deadly with each passing technological age, a complex system of government was devised to protect our citizens from harmful elements - including themselves."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MORAL_DEMOCRACY:0 "As we advanced through the technological ages, we also matured as a species. The violent and base impulses we inherited from our ancestors were done away with, and a global government was formed on the principles of peaceful coexistence."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_CELESTIAL_EMPIRE:0 "There was much darkness and sorrow in the early ages, as our people frequently gave in to their base instincts and turned upon one another. Then, suddenly, the clouds parted and a light from the heavens appeared, shining down upon the one who would become our first Celestial monarch. We were united at last."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_DESPOTIC_HEGEMONY:0 "Despite our rapid progression through the technological ages, as a species we were fragmented and inefficient. A new system emerged during these chaotic times that delivered us from superstitious beliefs and brought order to society. Some resisted this change out of irrational fear, but after several pacification wars they too became productive components of a greater whole."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_ILLUMINATED_AUTOCRACY:0 "The birth of science and rational thought necessitated the removal of those political leaders who impeded technological progress through ignorance, superstition, sheer stupidity or a combination of the three.

 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MEGACORPORATION:0 "In the early days, our people were governed by primitive feudal realms and inefficient nation states. Gradually, as global trade increased, the influence of private corporations grew steadily until their power far surpassed the governments that once tried to regulate them. After a series of mergers and violent take-overs during the destructive Corporate Wars, a single Megacorporation eventually emerged as the sole ruling body of our homeworld."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_TRADE_LEAGUE:0 "In the early days, our people were governed by primitive feudal realms and inefficient nation states. Gradually, as global trade increased, the myriad of corporations, consortiums and guilds into which our merchants organized themselves grew increasingly wealthy and influential. After a period of conflict and rivalry, the most powerful of these entities banded together into a trade league with enough power over the economy to become the de-facto world government."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MEGACHURCH:0 "As we progressed through the technological ages, there were many religions among our people that contended with each other for followers. In the late Industrial Age, a few pious visionaries realized the power of commercial mass-media, and together they built a business empire that succeeded in spreading the true faith to all corners of the globe."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_SUBVERSIVE_CULT:0 "As these communities expanded, a few bold visionaries established the religion that eventually grew into what we now know as the true faith. For generations, their followers were hounded and forced into hiding, and yet they bided their time. They built a vast criminal empire to spread their faith, which then grew into a business empire. When the time was right, they seized full control from the corrupt governments who had oppressed them."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_BANDIT_KINGDOM:0 "It is the ancient right of the strong to dominate the weak, and our society was built around this premise. If you cannot protect what is yours, then it belongs to whomever can take it. In this way, the strongest and most clever of us rose to power while the rest were forced in line."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_PURIFIER:0 "There were other [GetAdj] cultures, once, diluting the purity of our society with their weaknesses. These renegades were dealt with, one after the other, until our world had been utterly cleansed of their taint. Today only the pure remain."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_RULE_OF_TWO:0 "There are always two. The aspirant always seeks a master."
