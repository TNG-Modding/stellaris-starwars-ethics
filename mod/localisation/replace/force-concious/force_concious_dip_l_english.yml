  # Force Conscious to Machine Greetings
 SPIR_MECH_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are but soulless husks. Empty of spirit, devoid of meaning. An abominable facsimile of life."
 SPIR_MECH_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Clanking piles of junk! You defile the galaxy with your godless existence!"
 SPIR_MECH_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "What now, you infernal collection of clattering cogs?"

 # Evangelising Zealots
 EZ_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "The day when judgment will be passed on you grows ever closer."
 EZ_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Soon, communications from all your vessels will be blocked. None of you are free of sin."
 EZ_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "You lead people away from the truth with sweetened [From.GetRandomSpeciesSound] and promises of false spiritual rewards. The punishment that awaits for your kind cannot be spoken aloud."

 EZ_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "There is time for you yet to turn to the right path."
 EZ_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "We have found many lies throughout the galaxy, but we will ensure that the truth is also omnipresent."
 EZ_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "You have been lead astray. A wrongful conviction can be more dangerous than ignorance."
 EZ_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "Your minds have affixed themselves to the material plane. As long as you believe yourselves to be nothing but neurons and flesh, your minds will never be free."
 EZ_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "The power you hold is over the fire and dust of stars and planets. It holds no sway over the eternal and immortal beyond them."

 # Spiritual Seekers
 SS_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "[From.GetAdj] people emit an aura of unpleasantness. Have you considered what you might have done to bring this upon yourselves?"
 SS_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "We'd rather not associate with people of such poor spiritual hygiene."
 SS_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Your ill intentions can be felt through the soul of the world. Don't think you can hide your wickedness from us."
 SS_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "You cling to what you can measure and study, neglecting the depths of the universe, and your shallowness is tearing at your connection to other beings. How can you do this to us? How can you do this to yourselves?"

 SS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Well met, [From.GetName]. We have felt your presence in the universe, but have yet to determine your role in the grand events."
 SS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "[From.GetSpeciesName], [Root.GetSpeciesName], we are all pieces of a puzzle, the puzzle, that calls to the greatest minds among us all to solve it."
 SS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Whether you believe in your role in the universe is irrelevant. We will seek to unveil it regardless."
 SS_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "There is no need for life to destroy other life. Only by being merciful can you give purpose to your strength."
 SS_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "We could sense the [From.GetName], this nexus of warmth in the cold void of space, since before we left our planet. Now, we are finally united."
 SS_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "In a world so vast, where entire civilizations are like single threads in a weave, it is one of the great fortunes that the [Root.GetName] and the [From.GetName] would end up intertwined."
 SS_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "The [From.GetSpeciesName] are in touch with their inner beings like few species. Your magnificence may hold the key to the great mysteries of life."
 SS_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "The great weave of life is unraveling with each assault a people makes on another. Let us hope this conflict is a short one."
 SS_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "We feel each death we cause. Don't make us do this."
 SS_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "The evil you do does not dissipate, but will seek you out and return to its master. This is why your people suffer."
 SS_WAR_GREETING_04:0 "Whether victory or defeat, yours will be hollow. You believe you fight this battle on the material plane alone, poor fools."
 SS_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "Under your gentle guidance, we continue to look for answers to the great questions."
 SS_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_01:0 "The negative influence of [From.GetAdj] dominion on the spiritual well-being of the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] people is unquestionable. How much longer must we suffer this?"
