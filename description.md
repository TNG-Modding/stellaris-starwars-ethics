[h1]Ethics in Universe[/h1]
Many ethics-based civics, government names, and factions have been rebranded to fit the theme, such as the Council of Masters civic that replaces Exalted Priesthood.

[b]The Jedi and the Sith[/b]
While not necessarily Force related, the flavor of the Sith and Jedi have been redone as opposing philosophies regarding the proper use of power, rather than as existing governmental entities such as the Jedi Order or the Sith Empire. The Jedi ethic uses the symbol of the Jedi, while the Sith ethic uses the Dark Sun, a Sith symbol of power that is found in most Sith empire vexillology.

An empire does not need to engage with the Force to embody Sith or Jedi ideals. A Force wielding Sith Lord might very well find other Sith empires useful even if they do not use Force powers themselves.

[b]Force Consciousness[/b]
Empires following the Force conscious ethic are aware of the Force and take it into account in governance. Many of the events pertaining to spiritualism have been reworked to feel Star Wars, so no more god worshippers, divinities, or priests.

The Shroud ascension path has been replaced by a Force awakening, try it yourself and recontextualize your previous accomplishes!

[h1]Mod and Ironman Compatibility[/h1]
